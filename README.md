# Talks
Repository with my talks (from Nov 2019 onwards).
For the material that will be used in the Tutorial on Automated Machine Learning at ODSC Europe 2019, see the `odsc` folder.

-----
For practical purposes I might add files to this repository that were not made or presented by me (e.g. joint presentations).
A folder's README will specify which files, if any, were not created by me.
